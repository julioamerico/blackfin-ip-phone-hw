=*BLACKFIN IP PHONE*=

This is the project of a hardware platform based on a Blackfin processor for applications in IP telephony. This is the Google Code page for the project's first version, what consists of a wired IP phone. Hardware and firmware were developed for the first version that can be seen below. A second version hardware was developed to make it work in a wireless network scenario (please, refer to http://code.google.com/p/blackfin-ip-phone). Both versions are being developed by graduate and postgraduate students from Teleinformatics Engineering Department of Federal University of Ceará.

Feel free to research through all the project artifacts. It's open-source!
